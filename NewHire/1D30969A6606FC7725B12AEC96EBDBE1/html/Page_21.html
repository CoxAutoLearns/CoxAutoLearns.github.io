This includes healthcare services <br />provided and payment for those services. </div></div><br />Any of the following are considered identifiers under HIPAA: </div></div><br /> Patient names <br /> Telephone numbers <br /> Fax numbers <br /> Social Security Numbers <br /> Drivers license numbers <br /> Email addresses <br /> Dates (except year) </div></div><br /> Healthcare record numbers <br /> Account numbers <br /> Biometric identifiers <br /> Health plan beneficiary numbers <br /> Type of treatment or injury <br /> Demographic information <br /> Names of relatives </div></div><br />As a Cox HR representative, you are in a position to receive PHI from healthcare plans and/or team <br />members. Safeguarding this information is a top priority! </div></div><br />Who does HIPAA apply to? </div></div><br />HIPAA covers all team members covered by a medical and dental plan or a flexible spending account. <br />This also applies to retirees and team members our on long term disability (LTD) who are covered by Cox <br />medical plans. While short term disability (STD) and Workers Comp are not governed by HIPAA, you <br />should never share PHI with Workers Comp vendors or the STD plan. </div></div><br />Real World Examples </div></div><br />1. “Suzie” calls the ESC and during the conversation, she tells the Specialist that her son is a <br />diabetic and shares the name of their prescription. </div></div><br />2. “Jane” and “Tim” are talking in the lunchroom about their co-worker “Paul”, who was in- <br />volved in a car accident the previous night and is in the hospital with multiple fractures. </div></div><br />Cox Automove Global Learning </div></body></html>
